Go over each patients in SNV data. 
List all specific protein.mutation pairs for current patient. 
If any of these mutations are in ELASPIC, increase the count 
(without considering CORE or INTERFACE) Then, go to the next patient.

This can be thought of as another kind of baseline.

Note: We count only once if there are multiple occurrence of the same protein's mutations.
